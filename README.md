## Screens and Routing
The app uses a nested layout structure with expo-router for clean navigation:

* Root Layout (app/_layout.tsx): Handles the main stack navigation and initial route setup.
* Tab Layout (app/(tabs)/_layout.tsx): Contains the tab navigation screens, including "Create", "Contacts", "Your Mail", and "Settings".
